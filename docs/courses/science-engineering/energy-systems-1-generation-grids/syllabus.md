# Energy Systems I: Generation & Grids
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Explore how energy is generated and distributed via power grids.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Explain fossil, nuclear, and renewable generation technologies.
2. Analyze power grid operations and balancing methods.
3. Model dispatch and reliability scenarios.
4. Evaluate integration of renewables.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Generation Technologies** — fossil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar.
2. **Grid Fundamentals** — frequency, dispatch, balancing.
3. **Markets & Pricing** — locational marginal pricing (intro).
4. **Renewables** — intermittency and storage needs.
5. **Reliability** — N-1 contingency, blackout prevention.
6. **Integration Project** — dispatch modeling case.
