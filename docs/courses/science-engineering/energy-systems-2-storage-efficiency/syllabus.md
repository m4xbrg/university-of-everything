# Energy Systems II: Storage & Efficiency
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Study storage and efficiency for modern energy systems.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Compare energy storage technologies (batteries, hydro, hydrogen).
2. Model storage capacity, cycles, and degradation.
3. Identify efficiency opportunities in buildings and industry.
4. Assess tradeoffs for deployment.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Storage Tech** — batteries, pumped hydro, hydrogen.
2. **Modeling Storage** — cycles, losses, degradation.
3. **Efficiency** — industrial and building systems.
4. **Policy & Economics** — incentives, carbon pricing.
5. **Case Studies** — deployment scenarios.
6. **Integration Project** — storage/efficiency design case.
