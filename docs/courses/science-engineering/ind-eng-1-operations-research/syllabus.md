# Industrial Engineering I: Operations Research

**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Optimization & decision science for logistics, manufacturing, finance, and policy.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Formulate LP/IP models; interpret duals & sensitivity.
2. Solve optimization problems with solvers; validate results.
3. Analyze queues, scheduling, and networks.
4. Communicate tradeoffs and recommendations.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Modeling & LP** — decision variables, constraints, objectives; Simplex.
2. **Duality & Sensitivity** — shadow prices, ranges.
3. **Integer Programming** — knapsack, assignment, branch & bound.
4. **Queues & Simulation** — M/M/1; discrete-event basics.
5. **Networks** — shortest paths, flows.
6. **Integration** — mini-capstone: supply chain optimization.
