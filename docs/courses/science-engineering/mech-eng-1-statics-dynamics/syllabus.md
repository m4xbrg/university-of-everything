# Mechanical Engineering I: Statics & Dynamics

**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Analyze forces on structures and motion of bodies; bridge from physics to engineering design.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Draw correct FBDs; solve 2D/3D equilibrium.
2. Compute moments, centroids; analyze trusses/frames.
3. Solve particle and rigid-body dynamics; work-energy methods.
4. Use numerical tools for multi-step engineering calculations.
5. Explain design implications and safety factors.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Statics** — forces, moments, supports; equilibrium equations.
2. **Structures** — trusses, frames, shears & moments (intro).
3. **Dynamics** — kinematics & kinetics of particles/ridgid bodies.
4. **Energy/Impulse** — work-energy; impulse-momentum.
5. **Numerical Engineering** — sanity checks, units, and error.
6. **Integration** — mini-capstone: analyze a simple structure.
