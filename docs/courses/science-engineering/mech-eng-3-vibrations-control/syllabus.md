# Mechanical Engineering III: Vibrations & Control
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Analyze vibrations and basic control systems in mechanical structures.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Solve single and multi-degree-of-freedom vibration problems.
2. Model damping and resonance effects.
3. Apply transfer functions to simple control systems.
4. Evaluate stability with frequency response methods.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Single-DOF Vibrations** — free/forced response.
2. **Damping & Resonance** — under/over/critical damping.
3. **Multi-DOF Vibrations** — normal modes.
4. **Control Systems Basics** — transfer functions, block diagrams.
5. **Frequency Response** — Bode plots, stability margins.
6. **Integration Project** — vibration control case.
