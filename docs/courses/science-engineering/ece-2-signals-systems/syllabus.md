# Electrical Engineering II: Signals & Systems
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Analyze signals and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems in time and frequency domains; foundation for control, comms, and DSP.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Compute convolution and characterize LTI systems with impulse/step responses.
2. Use Laplace and Fourier transforms; interpret poles/zeros and spectra.
3. Design basic continuous-time filters and understand sampling/aliasing.
4. Connect signal models to real engineering/business problems.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Signals & Systems** — classification; LTI; convolution.
2. **Laplace Domain** — transforms, poles/zeros, stability.
3. **Fourier** — series/transform; filtering; spectra.
4. **Sampling** — Nyquist, aliasing, reconstruction.
5. **Discrete-Time Preview** — z-transform (overview).
6. **Integration Project** — design & analyze a simple filter for a real signal.
