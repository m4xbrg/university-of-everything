# Electrical Engineering II: Signals & Systems
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Time/frequency analysis of systems; foundation for control, communications, and DSP.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Analyze LTI systems via convolution and impulse response.
2. Work in time and frequency domains (Laplace/Fourier).
3. Design and interpret filters; understand sampling basics.
4. Connect signals concepts to modeling in engineering/business.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Signals & LTI** — convolution; impulse/step responses.
2. **Laplace** — transforms; poles/zeros; stability.
3. **Fourier** — series/transform; spectra; filtering.
4. **Sampling & Aliasing** — Nyquist; reconstruction.
5. **Discrete-Time (preview)** — z-transform basics.
6. **Integration** — mini-project: filter design and analysis.

## Resources
- **Primary:** Oppenheim/Willsky, *Signals & Systems*.
- **Tooling:** Python (NumPy/SciPy), MATLAB/Octave optional.

## Assignments & Evaluation
- **Problem Sets:** 6 sets.
- **Project:** Filter design + analysis (notebook + 4–6 page brief).
- **Integration:** Short memo linking to a real application (e.g., demand signals).
- **Weighting:** PS 55%, Project 35%, Integration 10%.

## Portfolio Output
- Notebook + memo in `portfolio/`.
