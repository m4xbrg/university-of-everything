# Computer Engineering Fundamentals: Digital Logic & Computer Architecture
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Build from logic gates to CPU-level organization to understand computers as engineered systems.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Design combinational and sequential logic circuits.
2. Describe datapath and control in a simple CPU.
3. Explain the memory hierarchy and performance tradeoffs.
4. Analyze ISA-level programs and microarchitectural implications.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Digital Logic Basics** — Boolean algebra, gates, Karnaugh maps.
2. **Sequential Logic** — latches, flip-flops, finite state machines.
3. **Datapath & Control** — ALU, registers, control signals.
4. **Instruction Set Architecture** — RISC vs CISC; assembly basics.
5. **Memory & Performance** — caches, pipelining (intro), throughput vs latency.
6. **Integration Project** — design a simple CPU or FSM subsystem (spec + simulation).

## Resources
- **Primary:** Patterson & Hennessy, *Computer Organization and Design*.
