# Computer Networks: An Introduction
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Understand how data moves across networks; foundations for distributed systems and the internet.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Explain layered architectures (OSI/TCP-IP) and responsibilities.
2. Analyze reliability, congestion, and routing at a high level.
3. Understand addressing, DNS, and basic security concepts.
4. Measure simple performance metrics (throughput, latency, loss).

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Foundations & Models** — OSI vs TCP/IP; sockets overview.
2. **Link & Network Layers** — Ethernet, IP, routing basics.
3. **Transport** — UDP, TCP reliability and flow control.
4. **Application Layer** — HTTP, DNS; REST basics.
5. **Performance & Measurement** — RTT, bottlenecks, traceroute.
6. **Integration Project** — small measurement study + report.

## Resources
- **Primary:** Kurose & Ross, *Computer Networking*.
- **Tooling:** Wireshark, traceroute/ping; Python sockets (simple).

## Assignments & Evaluation
- **Labs:** 3 short protocol labs.
- **Problem Sets:** 3.
- **Project:** Measurement/trace-based report.
- **Integration:** Security/operations memo.
- **Weighting:** Labs 40%, PS 40%, Integration 20%.

## Portfolio Output
- Lab reports + project writeup in `portfolio/`.
