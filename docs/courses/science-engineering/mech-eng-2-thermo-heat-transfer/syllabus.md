# Mechanical Engineering II: Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Energy, entropy, and heat movement; essential for engines, HVAC, power, and batteries.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Apply 1st/2nd Laws; compute efficiency and entropy changes.
2. Analyze conduction, convection, and radiation problems.
3. Model simple heat exchangers and cycles (Otto/Rankine intro).
4. Present tradeoffs and constraints for design decisions.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Thermo Fundamentals** — properties, states, processes.
2. **Energy & Entropy** — cycles; efficiency; irreversibility (intuition).
3. **Conduction** — 1D/2D; fins; composites.
4. **Convection** — forced/free; correlations.
5. **Radiation** — view factors; enclosures (intro).
6. **Integration** — mini-capstone: heat-exchanger sizing with memo.
