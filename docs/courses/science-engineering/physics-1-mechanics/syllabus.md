# Physics I: Mechanics

**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Build physical intuition for motion, forces, energy, and momentum; base for all engineering fields.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Model motion in 1D/2D; solve kinematics problems.
2. Apply Newton’s laws; analyze forces and free-body diagrams.
3. Use energy and momentum conservation appropriately.
4. Solve rotational dynamics; understand torque and angular momentum.
5. Communicate assumptions, approximations, and error sources.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Kinematics** — position, velocity, acceleration; projectile motion.
2. **Forces & Newton’s Laws** — FBDs, friction, circular motion.
3. **Work & Energy** — potential/kinetic energy, conservation.
4. **Momentum & Collisions** — impulse, elastic/inelastic analysis.
5. **Rotation** — torque, rotational kinematics, energy; rolling.
6. **Applications & Lab Synthesis** — mini-capstone lab report.
