# Electrical Engineering III: Control Systems
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Feedback and control theory applied to engineering and business systems.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Derive transfer functions and construct block diagrams.
2. Assess stability using root locus, Bode, and Nyquist methods.
3. Design PID controllers for simple systems.
4. Connect control theory to real-world systems.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Modeling** — transfer functions, state-space (intro).
2. **Time Response** — step response, settling time.
3. **Stability** — root locus, Routh-Hurwitz.
4. **Frequency Response** — Bode/Nyquist plots.
5. **Controller Design** — PID basics.
6. **Integration Project** — control system design memo.
