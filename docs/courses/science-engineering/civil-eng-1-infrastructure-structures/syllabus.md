# Civil Engineering I: Infrastructure & Structures
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** Survey the physical systems of society and introductory structural analysis.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Explain loads, supports, and structural response.
2. Read simple plans and reason about materials/codes.
3. Sketch shear/moment diagrams for simple beams (survey level).
4. Evaluate lifecycle, cost, and sustainability tradeoffs.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Infrastructure Overview** — transportation, water, buildings, energy.
2. **Loads & Materials** — dead/live; steel, concrete, wood (intro).
3. **Structural Response** — beams/columns; deflection (basic).
4. **Foundations & Geotech (survey)** — soils, bearing capacity (overview).
5. **Project Delivery** — stakeholders, codes, lifecycle.
6. **Integration Project** — concept design + tradeoff memo.
