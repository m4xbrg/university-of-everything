# Civil Engineering I: Infrastructure & Structures
**Pillar:** Science & Engineering  
**Purpose:** How we build and maintain the physical systems of society.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Classify loads and supports; basics of structural response.
2. Read simple plans; reason about materials & codes (intro).
3. Analyze beams (shear/moment diagrams at a survey level).
4. Connect design choices to cost, safety, and sustainability.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Infrastructure Overview** — roads, bridges, water, buildings.
2. **Loads & Materials (survey)** — dead/live; steel/concrete/wood basics.
3. **Structural Response** — beams/columns; deflection (intro).
4. **Foundations & Geotech (survey)** — soils; bearing capacity (high level).
5. **Project Delivery** — stakeholders; lifecycle; codes.
6. **Integration** — mini-project: concept design + tradeoff memo.

## Resources
- **Primary:** ICE/Oxford handbooks (selections); ASCE references.
- **Tooling:** Spreadsheets; drawing tools.

## Assignments & Evaluation
- **Problem Sets:** 3 short sets.
- **Project:** Concept design (short pack).
- **Integration:** Memo on sustainability & lifecycle.
- **Weighting:** PS 30%, Project 60%, Integration 10%.
