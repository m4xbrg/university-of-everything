# Meta-Learning I: Systems Thinking & Productivity

**Pillar:** Life / Creativity / Meta  
**Purpose:** Learn how to learn at scale; build systems for knowledge, time, and focus. Apply feedback-loop thinking to life and work.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Model complex problems with stocks, flows, and feedbacks.
2. Implement a personal knowledge system (PKM) and review cadence.
3. Use techniques: spaced repetition, deliberate practice, interleaving.
4. Build a weekly system for deep work, capture, and reflection.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Systems Thinking** — loops, delays, leverage points.
2. **Cognitive Principles** — memory, retrieval, practice.
3. **PKM Architecture** — capture, organize, distill, express.
4. **Deep Work & Routines** — time-blocking, habit design, reviews.
5. **Scaling Learning** — projects, portfolios, domains in parallel.
6. **Integration** — mini-capstone: your operating system (docs + demo).

## Resources
- **Primary:** Meadows, *Thinking in Systems*; selected cognitive science readings.
- **Tooling:** Your choice (Obsidian/Notion/Markdown + spaced repetition tool).

## Assignments & Evaluation
- **Exercises:** 5 weekly build-outs (PKM, schedule, reviews).
- **Project:** “Personal OS” with artifacts and SOPs.
- **Integration:** Reflection on how this supports capstones.
- **Weighting:** Exercises 40%, Project 50%, Integration 10%.

## Portfolio Output
- SOPs, screenshots (if desired), and a short screencast/script in `portfolio/`.
