# Calculus II
**Pillar:** Math & Logic  
**Purpose:** Integral calculus and sequences/series — essential for physics, engineering, and finance.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Evaluate definite and indefinite integrals using substitution, parts, trig, and partial fractions.
2. Apply integrals to compute areas, volumes, arc length, and probability.
3. Analyze convergence of improper integrals and infinite series.
4. Represent functions as power and Taylor series.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Integration Techniques** — substitution, parts, trig, partial fractions.
2. **Applications of Integration** — volumes (disk, shell), arc length, probability.
3. **Improper Integrals** — tests for convergence/divergence.
4. **Sequences & Series** — convergence tests, examples.
5. **Power Series & Taylor** — approximations and error analysis.
6. **Integration Project** — apply series to a modeling problem.
