# Discrete Mathematics
**Pillar:** Math & Logic  
**Purpose:** Foundations of discrete structures — logic, sets, combinatorics, graphs, algorithms.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Apply propositional and predicate logic to formal reasoning.
2. Use sets, functions, and relations in modeling.
3. Analyze counting problems with permutations, combinations, and recurrence.
4. Work with graphs, trees, and basic algorithms.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Logic & Proofs** — propositional, predicate, induction.
2. **Sets & Functions** — relations, equivalence, orders.
3. **Counting** — permutations, combinations, pigeonhole.
4. **Recurrence & Algorithms** — recurrence relations, complexity basics.
5. **Graphs & Trees** — connectivity, spanning trees, traversals.
6. **Integration Project** — applied discrete modeling.
