# Calculus I
**Pillar:** Math & Logic  
**Purpose:** Foundation of differential calculus for functions of one variable.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand limits, continuity, and derivatives.
2. Apply differentiation rules to polynomials, exponentials, trig, and composites.
3. Solve optimization and related rates problems.
4. Interpret derivatives in physical, economic, and business contexts.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Preliminaries** — functions, limits, continuity.
2. **Derivatives Basics** — definition, rules, product/quotient.
3. **Chain Rule & Implicit Differentiation** — applications.
4. **Applications** — related rates, optimization, curve sketching.
5. **Exponentials & Logarithms** — derivatives, growth/decay.
6. **Integration Project** — applied optimization/related rates case.
