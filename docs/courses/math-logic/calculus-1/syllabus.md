# Calculus I

**Pillar:** Math & Logic  
**Purpose:** Master the language of change (rates, slopes, optimization). Foundations for physics (motion), economics (marginal analysis), and engineering (optimization & modeling).

## Learning Outcomes
1. Compute limits and derivatives of elementary functions.
2. Apply differentiation to optimization, related rates, and curve analysis.
3. Explain the geometric and physical meaning of derivatives.
4. Use integrals at an introductory level; state the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
5. Communicate solutions clearly with correct notation and reasoning.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Functions & Limits** — functions, continuity, limit laws, squeeze theorem.
2. **Differentiation** — definition, rules (product, quotient), chain rule; implicit differentiation.
3. **Applications I** — optimization, related rates, linearization.
4. **Applications II** — curve sketching, asymptotes, L’Hôpital’s rule.
5. **Integrals (Preview)** — antiderivatives, Riemann sums, FTC (statement & intuition).
6. **Applications & Integration** — physics/econ cases; mini-capstone: optimization report.

## Resources
