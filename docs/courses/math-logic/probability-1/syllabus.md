# Probability & Statistics I
**Pillar:** Math & Logic  
**Purpose:** Introduce probability theory and descriptive statistics.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Compute probabilities for discrete and continuous random events.
2. Understand expectation, variance, and standard distributions.
3. Apply descriptive statistics to summarize data sets.
4. Recognize randomness in real-world systems.

## Modules & Weekly Topics
1. **Probability Basics** — sample spaces, rules, conditional probability.
2. **Discrete Random Variables** — expectation, binomial, geometric, Poisson.
3. **Continuous Random Variables** — uniform, normal, exponential.
4. **Joint Distributions** — covariance, correlation.
5. **Descriptive Statistics** — mean, median, variance, visualizations.
6. **Integration Project** — probability/statistics case study.
