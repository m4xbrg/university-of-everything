# Instructor Notes (Calculus I)
- Encourage sketching before algebra. Penalize unlabeled graphs.
- Use numeric/graphing checks (Desmos/Python) to validate symbolic work.
- Permit CAS for verification, but require hand derivations for credit.
- Spiral review in Weeks 7â€“10 consolidates common stumbling blocks.
