# Course Development Workflow

We build **one course at a time**, completing all steps before moving on.

## Per-Course Steps
1. Purpose paragraph
2. Learning outcomes (5–8)
3. Content modules (5–7 units; mapped to 10 weeks)
4. Core resources (textbooks, articles, lectures)
5. Assignments (≥6) + mini-capstone
6. Rubrics attached (PS/Essay/Lab/Case/Project)
7. Portfolio deliverable defined
8. Adjacent course links (See also)
9. Badge set (Draft / Assignments / Ready)
10. QA pass (links, spelling, consistency)

## Folder Layout (per course)
- `syllabus.md` — main course file
- `resources/` — PDFs, links, datasets
- `assignments/` — problem sets, essay prompts, lab briefs
- `rubrics/` — copy from global rubrics if customized
- `portfolio/` — description/example of final deliverable
- `notes/` — developer notes, TODOs

---

## Global Shared Assets
- `/rubrics/` — master rubrics
- `/resources/` — reading/problem banks
- `/assignments/` — reusable assignments
- `/portfolio/` — example artifacts/templates
